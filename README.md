# The Hero fashion trends website
---
Creator : Tayab Ajmal
Date : 20th of July, 2022.

Task at hand : Based on the given Figma file in .jpg format, recreate the website using HTML and CSS only.

Time spent to complete this project : 2 days.

As this website is not responsive yet, it may show up differently on different screensizes. I have therefore taken a screenshot of how the final result looked like when I finished the project. The screenshot can be seen under the assets folder and named "Final_result_tayabajmal.jpg". 

## Learning
---

I learnt a lot about how to position HTML elements on a webpage and how to use techniques like flexbox and positioning. Flexbox was not even covered yet in the syllabus at this point in time, but I used tutorials online to get my head around it. By using flexbox, you really appreciate the work of those who have created it. So much more easier to use flexbox than other more traditonal techniques. However, traditional techniques like float and positioning properties are important to know in order to have a strong fundamental grasp of how things work. Another techique I learnt is how we apply the z-index property to place element on top of the other, like I did by placing the grid behind the hero picture and then doing some adjustments so that parts of the grid would show. 

I also learnt about installing git on my local machine and then connect my project to Github. An appropriate flow of working with git locally and github centrally was not adopted in this project, as it was introduced a bit later in the course, in week 2. 

I am very happy and proud that I managed to complete this project without asking for help from our mentors (doubt support). It was tough to sit there and not know how to get around it, but the feeling was great when you managed to get the navigation bar correct after working on it for 5 hours. Yes, I spent 5 hours just on the navigation bar.

## Improvements
---
Several improvements could be done to this project, like making the website responsive using media queries for instance. At the time of completing the project, responsive webdesign had not been covered. Also, the text below the heading could have been wrapped at a smaller width. Instaead it is going too wide. Positining of the star and the globe could improve and come even more closer to the original figma file named thumbnail.png or 1.png. A second star is present in the figma file, that could have been added, but we were told not to touch the HTML code, just do the CSS.
